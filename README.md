# Carbon Design System
The Carbon Design System is a series of individual styles and components, that when combined make beautiful, intuitive designs. These designs are systemic and logical, as they all follow the same universal principles.

The Carbon Design System is comprised of:

* The [Carbon website](www.carbondesignsystem.com), containing documenation on our code base, UX patterns, and style specs.
* The [Carbon Design Kit](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit), a versioned Sketch file containing our entire component library, templates, and additional visual patterns. 
* The Carbon Component Library ([React](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react) and [Vanilla.js](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components)) is a collection of re-usable HTML and Sass partials for building products and experiences.


## Accessibility
All of the designs in the Carbon Design System meet the [WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility](https://www.section508.gov/) guidelines and are compliant with Section 508 standards. If you choose to customize these designs, please make sure they continue to meet these requirements.
