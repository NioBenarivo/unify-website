**_Brand_ is the unified experience that Bluemix presents to users, regardless of medium or environment. It reflects the Bluemix identity and purpose; it is more than what Bluemix looks like, it is who we are. Brand is how Bluemix users perceive it and what it feels like when they interact with the product.**

## Bluemix logo
![Bluemix logo](images/bluemix-1.0.svg)

The Bluemix logo is the most prominent visual element associated with our identity. The logo is a combination of the icon and wordmark. We are proud of our logo and recommend the following guidelines on this page.

### Wordmark

When using the workmark as a stand alone element, “IBM” should always be typeset in Helvetica Neue Light and “Bluemix” should always be typeset in Helvetica Neue Bold.

| Background | SCSS        | HEX      |
|------------|----------   |----------|
| Light      | $text-01    | #152935  |
| Dark       | $inverse-01 | #ffffff  |

### Icon

The Bluemix icon may be used on its own in cases where the Bluemix brand has already been established. Use the primary version when possible. However, use one of the following alternative icons if there are technical restraints:

<div data-insert-component="ImageGrid" data-dark-bg="2">
<div>
  ![Primary light background](images/bluemix-2.svg)
  **Primary icon**
  Light Background
</div>
<div>
  ![Primary dark background](images/bluemix-3.svg)
  **Primary icon**
  Dark Background
</div>
</div>


<div data-insert-component="ImageGrid" data-dark-bg="2,4">
<div>
  ![Decorative light background](images/bluemix-4.svg)
  **Decorative**
  Light Background
</div>
<div>
  ![Decorative dark background](images/bluemix-5.svg)
  **Decorative**
  Dark Background
</div>
<div>
  ![One-color solid light background](images/bluemix-6.svg)
  **One-color solid**
  Light Background
</div>
<div>
  ![One-color solid dark background](images/bluemix-7.svg)
  **One-color solid**
  Dark Background
</div>
</div>

## Logo usage

![Bluemix logo exclusion zone](images/bluemix-8.svg)

### Exclusion zone

No content is allowed in the exclusion zone. Note that the icon and wordmark are associated together. The exclusion zone is equal to the height of the “B” in the wordmark shown above as the magenta border around the logo.

### Spacing

The space between the icon and wordmark is determined by the trajectory of the outer angles of the right edges of top and bottom hexagons. It is demonstrated in the above image by the dotted lines that make an “X.”

| Icon type      | Minimum size     
|------------    |----------   
| Primary icon   | 24px   
| Decorative icon| 72px
| One-color solid| 24px

## Logo misuse

In order to maintain consistency, the logo should never be modified, transformed or reinterpreted. Below are examples of what not to do:

<div class="image-grid donts">
  <div>
    ![logo misuse example1](images/bluemix-9.svg)
    ![red-x](images/red-x.png) **Do not** use the old wordmark with a capital “M”.
  </div>
  <div>
    ![logo misuse example2](images/bluemix-10.png)
    ![red-x](images/red-x.png) **Do not** change the general appearance of the logo (no drop-shadows, feather, glow or other effects).
  </div>
  <div>
    ![logo misuse example3](images/bluemix-11.svg)
    ![red-x](images/red-x.png) **Do not** change the wordmark typeface or font weight.
  </div>
  <div>
    ![logo misuse example4](images/bluemix-12.svg)
    ![red-x](images/red-x.png) **Do not** skew or disproportionally scale the logo.
  </div>
  <div>
    ![logo misuse example5](images/bluemix-13.svg)
    ![red-x](images/red-x.png) **Do not** change the size relationship of the icon and wordmark.
  </div>
  <div>
    ![logo misuse example6](images/bluemix-14.svg)
    ![red-x](images/red-x.png) **Do not** invert the positioning of the icon and wordmark
  </div>
  <div>
    ![logo misuse example7](images/bluemix-15.svg)
    ![red-x](images/red-x.png) **Do not** use any other colors in the logo or icon other than the ones defined.
  </div>
  <div>
    ![logo misuse example8](images/bluemix-16.png)
    ![red-x](images/red-x.png) **Do not** place the logo on busy backgrounds that make it hard to distinguish.
  </div>
</div>

## Brand colors

Primary Bluemix brand colors are IBM Design Blue 30, Blue 80 and Teal 30. These colors directly correlate with the Bluemix identity. While we have other colors in our broader UI and communication palette, these three colors should be the most prominent outward-facing brand colors.

<div data-insert-component="BrandColors"></div>

### Best practices

* Use color with purpose.
* Use color, spacing, and sizing to create hierarchy and focus.
* If a brand color does not establish proper page hierarchy, evaluate all the visual elements (size, padding, spacing) before selecting a non-brand color.
* Use contrast to influence the legibility of a design.
* Understand visual deficiencies such as low vision and color blindness.
* Avoid eye strain (such as incompatible color combinations).
* Accommodate for visual deficiencies such as low vision and color blindness.
* Understand color associations across cultures.

## Brand fonts

Helvetica Neue is the official Bluemix font as well as one of the official fonts of the greater IBM Brand. Helvetica Neue should be used whenever possible.

# **Helvetica Neue Bold**
# Helvetica Neue Roman
# Helvetica Neue Light

## Parent brands

Bluemix falls under two parent brands, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/" target=blank>IBM Cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/" target=blank>IBM Design.</a> IBM Cloud is the product and business ecosystem in which Bluemix lives. IBM Design is the greater <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/language/" target=blank>design language</a> and practices we use to design and develop Bluemix.
