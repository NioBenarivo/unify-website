## Answers

#### <a name="q1">Who works on the Carbon Design System?</a>
Carbon has a [core team](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-design-system/people) of designers and front-end developers that are dedicated to developing and supporting the system. There are also countless other designers and developers in the IBM Cloud ecosystem who also contribute back to [carbon-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components#contributors) and [carbon-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react#contributors).

#### <a name="q2">How can I contribute and/or propose new components/ideas?</a>
We have guidelines for contributing back to [Carbon Components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components/blob/master/docs/contributing.md) and the [Carbon Design Kit](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We appreciate you helping out and contributing back.

#### <a name="q3">Which browsers are supported?</a>
Carbon components is supported in the following browsers:

- IE11
- IE Edge latest
- Firefox latest
- Chrome latest
- Safari latest

#### <a name="q4">What language are the components written in?</a>
There are two different implementations of the Carbon Design System. One is a Vanilla.js library; that's written in ES6+, SCSS, and HTML and ships deliverables in vanilla javascript in ES5 as well as ES6, CSS, SCSS, and HTML. The other is a React library, that ships a React rewrite of the javascript, but uses the same CSS as the core library.

There is also an unofficial [Angular library](https://pages.github.ibm.com/adaniel/angular-carbon-components/) for carbon components that was built out by a team other than Carbon.

#### <a name="q5">I see a bug, how do I report it?</a>
