## Format

Cards may be as minimal as having a title with an icon and description to being more detailed to include a chart, live metrics, or metadata.

### Icon usage

Icons are commonly used in Cards to provide context at a quick glance.

### Title

Titles describe the subject of the data on a Card.

### Description

The Card's description section lives just below the title, and can be used to provide additional information (IP address, URL, instance name).

### Footer

The footer is commonly used for interactive elements, which can be any of the following: secondary buttons, links, and action icons. It can also contain additional informational content, such as plan name or app status.

### Overflow menu

An overflow menu is a common pattern used within cards. When clicked, it presents additional menu options that directly relate to the card. For more usage guidelines, see [Overflow Menu.](/components/overflow-menu/usage)
