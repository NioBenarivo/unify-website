**Navigation Bar** appears at the top of an app screen, below the status bar, and enables navigation through a series of hierarchical screens. 

## Usage
<div data-insert-component="ImageGrid">
  <div class="mb-16">
    When a new screen is displayed, a back button appears on the left side of the bar. Sometimes, the right side of a navigation bar contains a control, like an Edit or a Done button, for managing the content within the active view.
    <br /><br />
    Consider showing the title of the current view in the navigation bar. In most cases, a title helps people understand what theyâ€™re looking at. However, if titling a navigation bar seems redundant, you can leave the title empty.
    <br /><br />
    Use a large title when you need to provide extra emphasis on context. In some apps, the big, bold text of a large title can help orient people as they browse and search. In a tabbed layout, for example, large titles can help clarify the active tab and inform the user when they've scrolled to the top
