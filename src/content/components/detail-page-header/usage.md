## Usage

* The Detail Page Header appears at the top of the page, and provides context to the content below.
* [Breadcrumbs](/components/breadcrumb) can be added to the Detail Page Header to give the user an additional sense of context.
* Additionally, [Tabs](/components/tabs) can be added to quickly navigate between views within the same context.

## Interaction

### Animation

The header above the content area extends across the entire viewport. When the user scrolls, the header shrinks to preserve vertical real estate. The tabs and breadcrumbs will hide while the title remains persistent along to top of the viewport.

### Responsive behavior

At 767px, the tabs in the Detail page header will collapse into a [Dropdown](/components/dropdown).
